i need to setup a timer for attacking cuz i cant have the player be able to spam attack forever

1- the timer gotta be 1 second
2- ill use a while loop to make the timer 

my brain literally feels so foggy rn so i need to map this out because i can NOT think straight rn 

--executing: 
1- setup a time variable, that will be the limit for the while loop 
2- setup a timer specifically for the test weapon
3- setup a while loop that looks like: 
   
   if attacked then timer = 0 

   while timer < time do 
     timer = timer + 0.1 
   end 

   if timer == 1 then 
    can_attack = true 
   end 

i literally feel so tired rn i dont even know how to make a while loop lmao 


--entry 2: its like december 2nd today so yeah a while loop doesnt work in this context cuz like it'd be already setup when i boot up the game, dont know much abot loops in lua anyways lolol, decided to use an if statment cuz like why not and it actually worked lmao
